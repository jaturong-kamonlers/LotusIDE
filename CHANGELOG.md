# Changelog

All notable changes to LotusIDE are documented here. Format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project
uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Manage Libraries** (Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries…) — the
  last "coming soon" item in the Lotus menu is now wired up. Backed by
  `arduino-cli lib`, so the install set is the full Arduino Library Index
  (10000+ libs). Tabs: Installed (list/uninstall), Search (the Arduino
  index), From Git/Zip (clones or unzips into the user lib dir), and
  Settings (update-index + show install path). Libraries land at
  `<userData>/arduino-cli/user/libraries/` — the same dir arduino-cli uses
  when compiling, so installs are picked up automatically without
  re-plumbing the build path.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-06-05

Community, sharing, and CI release pipeline.

### Added

- **Full GitHub repo sync** in the GitHub Manager. Pick a repo, browse
  folders with a breadcrumb, load any `.json` workspace, commit the
  current sketch with a custom path + message, and inspect per-file
  commit history (load any historic version into the editor). New repo
  creation has its own tab. Uses the GitHub Contents API — no local git,
  no isomorphic-git, no working copy. Trade-off: no offline edits, no
  merges.
- OAuth scope upgraded from `gist` → `repo gist`. A re-auth prompt shows
  when an existing token only has `gist`.
- GitHub status now reports `login` and granted `scopes` so the UI can
  gate features and show "Connected as @user (repo, gist)".
- **Share sketch as public link** — Gists tab has a new button that
  always creates a NEW public gist (point-in-time snapshot) and copies
  the URL to the clipboard.
- **Import from URL** (File → Import from URL…) — paste a gist URL, a
  github.com blob URL, a raw.githubusercontent.com URL, or a plain gist
  id; the dialog resolves it and loads the workspace.
- **Report Bug** (Help → Report Bug…) — opens GitHub Issues in a
  browser with a pre-filled template that includes OS, board, and the
  last 10 console log lines.
- **GitHub Actions release pipeline** (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
  — push a `v*` tag and CI builds the NSIS installer on a Windows
  runner, then uploads it as a draft GitHub Release with `latest.yml`
  for auto-update. Auth-aware downloader handles private-repo release
  assets. See `CI.md` for the end-to-end browser workflow.

### Changed

- `electron/ipc/github.js` `ghRequest` now exposes response headers so
  status can read `x-oauth-scopes`.
- `electron/ipc/marketplace.js` adds `fetchUrl` — generic HTTPS text
  fetcher used by Import-from-URL.
- `package.json` `build.directories.output` is now relative
  (`dist-electron`) instead of an absolute `E:/…` path, so CI runners
  and fresh clones build without manual config. Local devs who want
  builds off the system drive can `mklink /J dist-electron E:\…` per
  `RELEASE.md`.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-06-04

First release with auto-update and a community plugin/board pipeline.

### Added

- **Auto-update** via `electron-updater` + GitHub Releases provider.
  Check Help → Check for Updates. Background poll on launch (packaged builds
  only). Manual download / "Restart and install" flow keeps the user in
  control.
- **Plugin system** with sandboxed Web Worker execution. Each plugin is a
  zip containing `lotus-plugin.json` + `index.js`; the worker has no Node
  access, no `fetch`, no `XMLHttpRequest`. See `src/plugins/PLUGIN_API.md`.
- **Plugin manager UI** (Lotus → Plugins). Tabs for Installed, Available
  (catalog), From GitHub (paste `owner/repo`), and Settings.
- **Board manager UI** (Lotus → Manage Boards). Mirrors the plugin manager:
  Installed / Available / From GitHub / Settings. User-installed boards
  live at `%APPDATA%\Lotus IDE\boards\` and merge with the bundled
  `public/boards/` list (user-installed wins on id collision).
- **GitHub Gist sync** (Lotus → GitHub) for sketches. OAuth Device Flow —
  no local HTTP server required. Token stored via Electron `safeStorage`
  (OS keychain).
- **Marketplace IPC** (`electron/ipc/marketplace.js`) — generic catalog
  fetcher + GitHub release resolver, shared by the plugin and board
  managers.
- **Multi-machine setup tooling** — `scripts/setup-resources.ps1` and
  `SETUP.md` so the toolchain (8.5 GB) is reproducible on a fresh clone.
- **Docs**: `RELEASE.md` (publishing the app), `PUBLISHING.md` (community
  plugin/board guide), `PLATFORMS.md` (Linux/Ubuntu prep), `SETUP.md`
  (multi-machine workflow).

### Changed

- `electron/ipc/arduino.js` — `boards:list` now merges
  `%APPDATA%/Lotus IDE/boards/` with `public/boards/`. `getBlockFiles` and
  `getConfig` resolve through a shared helper so user boards work the same
  as bundled ones.
- `electron/main.js` — `kbide://` protocol now falls back to `public/`
  when `C:\KBIDE_Lotus` isn't present (so non-Windows / non-dev installs
  still resolve board assets).
- Executable suffix is gated by `process.platform === 'win32'` (constant
  `EXE` in `electron/ipc/arduino.js`). Pre-work for Ubuntu builds.
- `package.json` adds `build.publish` (GitHub provider), `build.linux`
  target (AppImage + .deb), `author`, `repository`, `homepage`.

### Known issues (carried from v1.0.0)

- Inner `Lotus IDE.exe` still uses Electron's default icon (installer + main
  window icons are correct). See `project_lotus_ide_build` memory.
- Windows Defender may slow rebuilds — disable real-time protection before
  large builds, then re-enable.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-29

Initial Windows installer build.

### Added

- Electron 30 + Vue 3 + Vuetify 3 shell.
- Blockly editor with Lotus block sets (GPIO, Time, Serial, Math, Logic,
  Loops, Text, Task) and per-board categories sourced from
  `public/boards/<id>/block/`.
- Arduino CLI integration for ESP32, AVR, SAM cores.
- USB-to-serial driver launchers (CP210x, CH340) bundled where licensing
  permits.
- NSIS installer (`Lotus IDE Setup 1.0.0.exe`, ~779 MB).
